## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you have found a vulnerability, please report it privately to avoid disclosing it to malicious actors before a patch can be released.

**Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

We use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature to handle security disclosures.

1. Navigate to the **[Security](https://github.com/ntoulasm/isense/security)** tab of the repository.
2. Look for the **"Report a vulnerability"** button.
3. Fill out the form with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce.

We will review your report and respond as soon as possible.
